# Dan Demo

Inspired from [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon)'s [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLF0n9SACd4) at [JSConf Iceland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzoVCacndDCfGDf41P-z0iA)

> Note: The difference between Dan's demo and this app is that, All the charts render with random input rather than statically computed value.
